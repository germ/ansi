ansi: Escape codes for human beings

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Ever have a command line utility that needed that
extra little bit of `pop!`? ansi has your back. 

Just call Construct with the values you want and print
the result. Be sure to print Clear after to remove the
applied formatting.

Keep calm, Hack on!
